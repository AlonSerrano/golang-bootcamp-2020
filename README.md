# ZipCode of Mexico Golang for the Bootcamp  
  
## Introduction  
  
The following project is designed to obtain the postal data of the official post office of Mexico in csv format and then store the information in a database in MongoDB and proceed to consult the colonies referring to a postal code as a result in json  
  
## Requirements  
  
You need to install MongoDB either with the normal [installer](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) or in docker and run it on 

> port 27017

Docker

```shell script
docker pull mongo
```
    
    

## Run the code

Run

```shell script
 go install
```
   

And finally

 ```shell script
  go run main.goo install
 ```    

  

## About the project

To be able to consult the data, you must first fill the tables, so you must execute a get-type request to the method:

    localhost:8080/api/v1/address/populate

*What happens behind the scenes is that the code makes a request to a government endpoint which returns a csv with all the zip codes, a 15mb file _(145,110 approximate zip codes)_    
    
Once you get the response of the inserted ids that will take approximately 15 seconds on complete, you can now check the colonies that belong to a postal code with the method

    localhost:8080/api/v1/address/search/:zipCode

For example:

    localhost:8080/api/v1/address/search/97306

And an example of the previous request would be the following:


  ```json 
    [
      {
        "Id": "56eb060711d84d67ab164e862c5eb0f1",

        "CodigoPostal": "97306",
        "Estado": "Yucatán",
        "EstadoISO": "MX-YUC",
        "Municipio": "Mérida",
        "Ciudad": "",
        "Barrio": "Chichi Díaz"
      }
    ]
```

## Unit test

Two unit tests were created that test these two end-point on the path

> /golang-bootcamp-2020/pkg/util/zipcodes_test.go

First run the unit test 

 ```go
  Test_getCSVCodes()
```
And then 

 ```go
  Test_searchZipCodes()
```

Another unit test was created to test the correct flushing of the zipcodes table, run it if you want

 ```go
  Test_dropZipCodes()
```
